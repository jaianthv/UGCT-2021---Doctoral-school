# ImageJ manual 
ImageJ is a wonderful tool suitable for processing any type of image. It has a good graphical user interface and easy to use for users with any level of experience. One can process the images manually or by programming a macro or imageJ macro(ijm) or using java. In this course we will use the manual approach. This document would serve as a  refernce manual to carry out some image processing function discussed during this course.

## ImageJ installation
Go to this [link](https://imagej.net/software/fiji/). Dowload the .zip file, extract and you are done. A plugin suitable for 3D analysis is MorphoLibJ under the plugin IJPB. To install this plug in, open imagej go to help --> press "update.." it will check for the updates and another window will appear. Press "Manage update sites". Under name find "FIJI", "3D imageJ suite" and "IJPB plugins"; and check the boxes on the left. Then close the current window and press "Apply changes" in the previous window and let it install, once done restart and imageJ is ready. You can open imageJ and under plugin check if you can see MorphLibJ.

Now you are ready with everything needed for this course. In case you had any trouble during the installation, you ask the person in charge of the course or better ask google :)
